# tidyxl
This repo is to accompany my blog post at https://omicsbialystok.wordpress.com/. I am showing you how I use tidyxl and unpivotr to clean Excel files in R.

I describe my process in two parts: 

1. Part one: loading Excel data into R using tidyxl and behead headers using unpivotr (published: 22 June 2021)
2. Part two: cleaning the data and extracting color information (planned: 6 July 2021)

The sample data is named "sample_data.xlsx". This file contains a summary of data issues I have been handling lately. 

Each part contains several files:
1. R code 
2. Reports in PDF format
3. Output file in csv that resulted from running the R code

Let me know if you have any questions or found issues with the files!
